# Creating an Employee Tracker Using SQL

## Description

<!-- I don't know about you, but every day there's at least 2-3 things I write down as notes to myself. However, instead of writing reminders on random pieces of paper, I can now utilize my note-taker and so can you! I used the npm package, [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) to help create my site. Express is a a Node.js web framework, that allows its' users to structure web applications to handle different http requests at a specific url. Below are pictures of the final results!   -->

## Installation

To use the npm packages, "inquirer" and "mysql2", I typed the following code into the command line:

```
npm i inquirer@8.2.4 mysql2
```

The npm package, "console.table" was also utilized. The following was typed into the command line to install it: 

```
npm i console.table --save
```

## Usage

<!-- In order to get my site up and running using Heroku, my repo needed the following four items:

1. gitnore - Allows Node to run.  

2. [package.json](https://heynode.com/tutorial/what-packagejson/) -  This JSON file holds important information that the program uses. 

3. server.js - This file creates the server (among other things)! 

4. PORT - The PORT is defined in the server.js file. When connecting to Heroku, it's important to include the code:

```
process.env.PORT || Enter Port Number
```

I used the PORT number 9002, however you can use whatever number you want when creating the PORT.

After creating the server, you can run it by typing this line of code into the terminal: -->

```
node index.js
```

<!-- Once you do that, it should be awake (if you use app.listen - lines 21-23)! 

![serverawake](./public/assets/css/images/server-awake.png)

*Note- If you want to kill the server, within the terminal, click "control + C". 

The purpose of a server is to listen for a request, AND send back a response. To get a response, routes need to be created, utilizing HTTP request methods. There are four request methods, and for my website I used the first 3 listed below:

1. POST - Creates
2. GET  - Reads
3. DELETE - Deletes
4. PUT - Updates

When I made routes, in order to make the code easier to follow, I created a "routes" folder, and created two js files- one for api routes, and one for html routes. I then connected them to the server.js file (can be seen on lines 16 & 17 in the screenshot above). 

Check out my code below to see the HTTP requests! 

<strong>Api Route</strong>

<strong>HTML Route</strong>

Before deploying via Heroku, I tested my node server to make sure everything was working smoothly! -->
